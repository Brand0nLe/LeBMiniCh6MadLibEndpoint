# MiniCh6MadLibEndpoint

# Web API project that will take users inputs from the URL and it will print out a MAD LIB with the users inputs. I included a instructions page to help the user and guide them to which input comes next ex: name1, number1, etc. I also provided a example to show how it would look as a finished URL or if they were lazy and wanted to use my story.
