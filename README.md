Mini Challenge 6 - Mad Lib Endpoint

Web API project that will take users inputs from the URL and it will print out a MAD LIB with the users inputs. I included a instructions page to help the user and guide them to which input comes next ex: name1, number1, etc. I also provided a example to show how it would look as a finished URL or if they were lazy and wanted to use my story.

# Directions:
1. Open the file in visual studio code.
2. Run the debug either by clicking on the "run and debug" icon on the left side and then the green play button, or by using the F5 command.
3. Next you want to go to your debug console located on the bottom by your terminal.
4. Then look for the "Now listening on:" and there should be a local host URL that you can copy.
5. Take that URL and you can either paste it into a web browser, or by using an application called Postman, you can hit the plus sign at the top of Postman and paste the URL there.
6. After you paste the localhost URL either into a browser or postman, add /MiniCh6 at the end and press send. For example: https://localhost:7242/MiniCh6 and this will lead you to an instructions page to help guide you through the mad lib! *See end of directions for what the Instructions page will look like*
7. At this point you're almost done! Just add all of your gathered inputs for the madlib at the end of the URL and press send! For example my URL would look like this: https://localhost:7242/MiniCh6/MadLib/Brandon/Daniel/Chocolate/banana/4/giraffe/red/7/sad/100
8. If you're having trouble don't forget to check your local host to make sure you're using the right number and ensure that you ran the debug before attempting to use the URL in your web browser or Postman.

*Directions step 6 - What the instructions page will look like when you enter https://localhost:7242/MiniCh6 into Postman or a web browser*

Hello! Let's do a MAD LIB together! :) 

First you will need to collect the following information: 

 Choose a name. 
 
 Choose another name. 
 
 Choose a yummy flavor. 
 
 Choose a nasty flavor. 
 
 Choose a number. 
 
 Choose an animal. 
 
 Choose a color. 
 
 Choose another number. 
 
 Choose an emotion. 
 
 Choose one last number!
 

 Awesome you have everything chosen! Now you just have to input them into the URL!
 
 Enter the following URL with your chosen inputs:
 
 https://localhost:7242/MiniCh6/MadLib/name1/name2/yummyflavor/nastyflavor/number1/animal/Color/number2/emotion/number3 
 
 For example my madlib URL would be:
 
 https://localhost:7242/MiniCh6/MadLib/Brandon/Daniel/Chocolate/banana/4/giraffe/red/7/sad/100
 
 Copy and paste it to try it out or you can make your own mad lib! Have fun! :)

 **Double check your localhost to make sure that's correct before running your URL**
